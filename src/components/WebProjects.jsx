        "I planned, designed, and developed a full-stack web application for a restaurant using a MERN stack, featuring a user-friendly interface with React, TailwindCSS, and DaisyUI. The application included a secure admin dashboard for staff, allowing them to manage menu items with image uploads via Cloudinary, powered by RESTful APIs with Express.js and MongoDB. To enhance accessibility, I implemented multilingual support using Google Translate. The frontend was hosted on Netlify, while the backend was deployed on Heroku. I collaborated closely with restaurant staff, gathering feedback to ensure the websiteâ€™s design and features met both user needs and business goals.",
